# SEEK-VFI: Spectral Ensembling of topic models with Eigenscore for K-Agnostic Variable Feature Identification

## Purpose of SEEK-VFI

This package implements the method presented in the paper "Identification of Trajectory-Relevant Genes with SEEK-VFI" (Danning et al.).

SEEK-VFI is an ensemble machine learning method for identifying trajectory-relevant genes from gene expression count data.

## Getting started
To install the R package 'seekvfi', enter the following commands in R:

`install.packages("devtools")`

`library(devtools)`

`install_github("rdanning/seekvfi")`

For a quick guide to using seekvec in R, please see the [Tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rdanning/seekvfi/blob/main/vignettes/tutorial.html).
